# ofxConsoleListener
An openFrameworks addon for reading the console from which the application was launched. Especially useful when you want to start and control your application through SSH.

Works on Windows and Linux (Raspberry Pi included) systems. The Linux support is based on ncurses, so you may need to install it before compiling the addon.
